                <h1>Our History</h1>
                The founder of Food For The Nations, Joanne Fournillier, and her two kids, Monique and Jovan, began feeding the homeless on Easter and Thanksgiving in New York City. Joanne spent a few years not only giving the meals but sharing a word of encouragement and hope for a better tomorrow. The family also took clothing and toys to the kids who lived at the shelters, at this time a close friend joined the group as Joanneâ€™s desire to do more became evident. As a single  parent of two kids she understood the story of some and helped in whatever way she could. Her faith being the motivator.

                In 2007, after a years of witnessing the harsh reality of homelessness and food insecurity, Food For The Nations was formed and registered as a non profit organization.

                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                Food For The Nations distributes food for local, national and international causes meeting the needs of the hungry and hurting. We equip them through counseling to become self-sufficient and eventually provide for themselves. We actively support the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Global Church.
